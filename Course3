Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Sudha Kumari 
Dynamic Programming
-- Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same   inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
